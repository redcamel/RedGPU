# Environment

Now that shadows have been applied and a sense of three-dimensionality has been formed, it's time to add infinite backgrounds and photorealistic light information. RedGPU provides Skybox and IBL (Image-Based Lighting) features to maximize the realism of 3D scenes.

## Main Learning Topics

- **[SkyBox](./skybox.md)**: Fills the scene background with 360-degree textures to provide a vast sense of space.
- **[IBL](./ibl.md)**: Analyzes light information from the surrounding environment to apply realistic reflection and lighting to objects.

::: info [Learning Guide]
First, we will look at **SkyBox**, which defines the background of the space, and then **IBL**, where the background acts as actual lighting for objects.
